# Event Listener
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### The project created to practice using an event listener in framework React:
* Two identical counters, the first uses functional components (hooks - used to control state), the second using a class component (the old method);
* Feedback is a functional component that has three buttons: Good, Neutral and Bad. After the user leaves rating, a statistics component appears at the bottom that counts the number of reviews left by category, the total and the percentage of positive reviews left;
* The phone book is a functional component that has two fields for entering a name and phone number; after entering this data, a list of added contacts is created below, which we can delete, view details (a modal window opens) or find the contact we need by name. This project uses the [nanoid](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nanoid) library, which creates an id for each contact and [notiflix](https://notiflix.github.io/notify).
